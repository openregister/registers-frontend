        %h3.govuk-heading-m What is a register?
        %p A register is a list of information that is managed and approved by government.
        %p For example, the country register lists all countries recognised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
        %p You can use registers to build your government service.
        %p The UK Parliament petitions service uses the country register to help users select their country from a dropdown menu, for instance.
        %h3{class: 'govuk-heading-m govuk-!-padding-top-5'} Trusted by government services
        %p By using registers you can:
        %ul.list.list-bullet

          %li be confident that your service is using the most up&ndash;to&ndash;date government data
          %li receive data that is ready to use with no need for data cleansing
