      %p The data controller for GDS is the Cabinet Office. The data controller determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. For more information see the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) #{link_to 'Data Protection Public Register', "https://ico.org.uk/esdwebpages/search"}.

      %h2#what-data-we-need.heading-medium What data we need

      %ul.list.list-bullet
        %li your name
        %li your email address
        %li your organisation
        %li your IP address
        %li unique identifiers, such as session cookies

      %h2#why-we-need-your-data.heading-medium Why we need your data
      %p As a government service, we want to make sure GOV.UK Registers works for everyone. We collect and process data about you to help us understand more about our users and improve our service.
      %p We also need to keep personal information for anyone who creates an API key. For example, so we can revoke your API key or update your details if you ask us to. API keys are tokens used to identify the origin of requests to our APIs. We use API keys to track and control how our APIs are being used.

      %h2#what-we-do-with-your-data.heading-medium What we do with your data
      %p We store the data you provide to:
      %ul.list.list-bullet
        %li send you updates and notices
        %li compile usage reports for internal use
        %li revoke your API key or update your details if you ask us to

        %li sell or rent your data to 3rd parties
        %li share your data with 3rd parties for marketing purposes

      %h2#how-long-we-keep-your-data.heading-medium How long we keep your data
      %p We will only retain your personal data for as long as:
      %ul.list.list-bullet
        %li the law requires us to
        %li we need to provide this service
      %p In general, this means that we will only hold their personal data for a minimum of 90 days and a maximum of 2 years.

      %h2#childrens-privacy-protection.heading-medium Children’s privacy protection
      %p We understand the importance of protecting children’s privacy online. Our services are not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children 13 years of age or younger. It is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain data about anyone under the age of 13.

      %h2#where-is-your-data-stored-and-processed.heading-medium Where your data is processed and stored
      %p We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.
      %p All personal data on GOV.UK Registers is processed, stored and managed entirely in the European Economic Area (EEA), and will not be transferred outside of it. This means that it is covered by EU Data Protection regulations.

      %h2#how-we-protect-your-data-and-keep-it-secure.heading-medium How we protect your data and keep it secure
      %p We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. All 3rd parties who process personal data for GDS are required to keep that data secure.

      %h2#what-are-your-rights.heading-medium What are your rights
      %p You have the right to request:
      %ul.list.list-bullet
        %li information about how your personal data is processed
        %li a copy of that personal data - this copy will be provided in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format
        %li that anything inaccurate in your personal data is corrected immediately
      %p You can also:
      %ul.list.list-bullet
        %li raise an objection about how your personal data is processed
        %li request that your personal data is erased if there is no longer a justification for it
        %li ask that the processing of your personal data is restricted in certain circumstances
      %p If you have any of these requests, get in contact with our #{link_to 'Data Protection Officer', "#questions-and-complaints"}.
